The URL you requested could not be found. I'll give you a few obvious
and unhelpful suggestions to distract you from the fact that I'm still
tracking this request with Google Analytics:

* You could try going to the [homepage](/)?
* Perhaps you'd like to take a look at [posts tagged ruby](/tags/ruby.html)?
* Alternatively, you can have a look at [all the posts](/all_posts.html)!

Looking for something else? Well, here's a tomato with an erection.

<figure class="display-mode" id="figure-overview">
  <img src="/images/tomato-erection.png"
    alt="Figure: Erect Tomato" />
  <figcaption>Erect Tomato</figcaption>
</figure>
