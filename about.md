title: About Me
---
There's a high degree of probability that my name is Ian D. Eccles.
Assuming that premise is true, here are a few facts about me.

* I sing the body [Github](https://github.com/iande)
  and contribute to [meadvillerb](https://github.com/meadvillerb)
* I shoot [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/ieccles) into the air
* It's a good life with [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
  and [haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
* Of late I think of [Robert Culp's hair](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191685/)
  (circa 1970's)
