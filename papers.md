An assortment of papers and documents I've written that may be useful but
have not been converted to HTML.

* [Circular Context Menus](/papers/ccm01.01.11.2005.pdf)
  Some calculations on using circular Context Menus in computer applications.
  I certainly didn't invent these, these are just some calculations I did to
  reinforce their utility.  I doubt the creators of
  [Sketch Book Pro](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=6848332&siteID=123112)
  were influenced by my work, but they did get the UI right.
* Fractional Calculus
  Divided into two brief pages, one for functions of the form
  [x<sup>n</sup>](/papers/fractional-trivials.pdf) and one for
  [general polynomials](/papers/fractional-polynomials.pdf).  Certainly not
  invented by me (see:
  [Fractional Calculus on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus).)
  These pages only include the formulae for calculating half-derivatives and
  half-integrals.
