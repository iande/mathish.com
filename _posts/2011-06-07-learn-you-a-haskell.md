To be completely honest, I'm not much of a reader.  My reading speed lies
somewhere between "painfully slow" and "potentially illiterate," so reading
fiction, in particular, is more chore than hobby.  I love works of reference
when they have well constructed indices or, better yet, hyperlinks
between related topics &mdash; my bookshelves and wikipedia usage can
attest to this.  I'm also fascinated with "meta-reading" fiction, where I read
summaries, critiques and so forth of some work to gain insights into what
it's all about, but without reading the actual source material.  This
fascination is probably the only reason I didn't fail every high school
English class.  The point of this, which I'm dangerously close to completely
losing, is that my thoughts on a book are generally not of much use to anyone
else.

With all of that in mind, I will say that
*[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)* is
probably the best book I've purchased in a while.  I'm only into the 6th
chapter now &mdash; again, painfully slow reading speed &mdash; but the
tone, narrative, examples and pretty pictures make it an enjoyable read for
me.  There are externalities working in *LYAH*'s favor, namely my strong
interest in Haskell as it appeals to "mathematics degree" brain, and a recent
uneasiness I've developed regarding some elements of the Ruby/Rails world;
however, I think the book would be just as engaging without these factors.

So, if you're the kind of person who buys books based upon reviews that
could have been written by an 11 year old, [pick up a copy](http://nostarch.com/lyah.htm)
of *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* right now.
