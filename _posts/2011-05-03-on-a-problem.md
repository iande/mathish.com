title: A Thought on File Processing
---
### Background

Suppose we want to create a service that allows authors to upload digital
books to be stored in "the cloud."  Let's also suppose that each book weighs
in at 5 Mb, on average.  We also want to compile some meta-data for each book
so we can categorize an author's library, select an excerpt from each book to
serve as a good summary of its topic, and expose an author to others who write
about similar subjects.  Finally, let's suppose that we have attracted the
attention of scads of prolific authors, perhaps a million authors each having
a hundred books to their name.  Assuming no duplicates, we're looking at
about 475 Tb of data that needs stored and processed.

### Overview of Solution

### Transfer and Storage of the Books

### Processing the Meta-data

### The Lines of Communication

### Growing the System

### An Optimization: Let Authors Pull Their Weight
