In working out the particulars of a
[failover](https://github.com/iande/stomper-failover) extension to
[Stomper](https://github.com/iande/stomper), I discovered a few subtle but
frustrating bugs.  As a result, I pushed out 3 versions of the
[Stomper gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/stomper) today.
This may be the greatest accomplishment of my life.

At the risk of sounding crazy, I've replaced my toes with grapes.
