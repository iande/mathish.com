The [OnStomp](https://github.com/meadvillerb/onstomp) gem version 1.0.0 has been
released.  It deprecates my previous Ruby stomp client
[Stomper](https://github.com/iande/stomper).

OnStomp supports both the 1.0 and 1.1 STOMP protocols, sports an event-driven
interface and reads and writes sockets through non-blocking goodness.
You install the gem with

    gem install onstomp


While you're at it, why not have a cup of coffee and peruse
[the docs](http://mdvlrb.com/onstomp).  I'm in the process of writing user
and developer "narratives," but the code itself has been documented with
[YARD](http://yardoc.org/) (Yay!)

While I am the only contributor / author of the gem, I'm putting this under
the [meadvillerb](https://github.com/meadvillerb) community to inflate its
codebase and maybe foster some Meadville Ruby action.

You can report any issues through the
[bugtracker](https://github.com/meadvillerb/onstomp/issues).

Note to self: roll with one markup language, using textile and markdown in
different contexts results in a lot of editing.
