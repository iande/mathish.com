I had been pretty happy using [Enki](http://www.enkiblog.com/) to drive this
site.  It's minimal but sufficient, and very easy to tweak.  However, one of
Enki's major design decisions drove me into the loving arms of
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll): the use of OpenID for
authentication.  To be fair, I'm mostly pissed at
[myOpenID](https://www.myopenid.com/), which has failed to authenticate me
several times over the last few months and today appears to have lost my
account entirely (sort of.)  Nonetheless, Enki relies on OpenID for
authentication, and myOpenID divorced me, took the kids, and sold my house.

On the up side, moving to Jekyll gave me an excuse to play around with HTML5
and a new layout that I'll no doubt be tweaking for some time to come.

If you're using a browser that doesn't support HTML5 elements, this new
layout will probably look like total bullshit, but that's okay for a couple
reasons.  First, I really do want to dive further into HTML5 and CSS3.
Second, I don't think this site's content warrants maximum cross-browser
compatibility.

That's all for now, more to come soon now that I can blog with the combined
powers of `TextMate` and `git`.

*Postscript*: I'm now using [disqus](http://disqus.com/) for comments.
Hopefully I don't end up regretting this decision.

*Postscript 2*: I've deleted what was left of my myOpenID account.  Farewell
OpenID, you were an interesting experiment, but I think your utility is going
to be relegated largely to the fringe.
